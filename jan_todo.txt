Features to be included in the exchange

Feature	 	  	      	    	Explenation
					
- (Potentailly flutter interface)	Maybe get flutter interface (or any other frontend framework)
  	       	       			to visualize charts and other metrics nicely.


Potential Additions:

- Maybe some encryption stuff		Maybe the Exchange offers some kind of security guarantee, so.
  	     				so that an adversary cannot manipulate bot orders to exchange

- Add some lwt

TODO:
- Alot of edge cases, times where we double log or dont catch an exception
- Fix base funds to something realistic
